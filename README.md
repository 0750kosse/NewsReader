# NewsReader
This is an exercise on producing an UI for a responsive news reader app which allows the user to view news stories from around the world.<br><br>
It fetches the data fromÂ News API, displays the latest news and redirects the user to the particular new source selected.<br><br>
I have also implemented a search component which allows the user to submit a search query, and the app will return & display the results for such search. For example a search query such as "Coronavirus" will return all the articles mentioning Coronavirus.
# Technologies used
HTML & CSS with responsive design Javascript
